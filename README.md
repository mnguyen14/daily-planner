# daily-planner
https://mnguyen14.github.io/daily-planner/

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a daily planner where you can input what you have planned in increments of hours.

I was given an HTML and CSS page. 
All I had to do for the HTML page was link the JavaScript and add time-blocks that looked similar to the example I was given.

I used Javascript and JQuery to put together a daily planner.
It will save what you type into each textbox into the local storage and it'll stay there once you click the save button, even upon refresh.

The pre-given CSS had a present, past, and future class so I set those boundaries for our timeblock's colors based on the current time.
Unfortunately due to the time of screen shotting the images I can't show off the other colors.
You can see that all the timeblocks are in the "past" colorway as it was after 5pm when I recorded the demo.
Though there is already text in the box you can delete and type something else and it will overwrite it when you save it.

When you type something and don't hit save, it will not save it for you.
