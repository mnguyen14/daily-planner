# daily-planner
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a daily planner where you can input what you have planned in increments of hours.

I was given an HTML and CSS page. 
All I had to do for the HTML page was link the JavaScript and add time-blocks that looked similar to the example we were given.

I used Javascript and JQuery to put together a daily planner.
It will save what you type into each textbox into the local storage and it'll stay there once you click the save button, even upon refresh.
The pre-given CSS had a present, past, and future class so we set those boundaries for our timeblock's colors based on the current time.
